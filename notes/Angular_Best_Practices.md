# Angular Best Practices

When developing Angular applications, following best practices can lead to more maintainable, scalable, and performant code. Here are some Angular best practices with examples:

## 1. Use Angular CLI for Project Setup

**Best Practice**: Always use the Angular CLI for project setup. It provides a standardized project structure and automates common tasks.

**Example**: To create a new Angular project, run the following command:

```bash
ng new my-app
```

## 2. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Best Practice**: Keep components, services, and modules focused on a single responsibility. This makes your code more maintainable and testable.

**Example**: Create separate components for displaying user details and editing user details, rather than combining both functionalities in a single component.

## 3. Modularize Your Application

**Best Practice**: Organize your code into feature modules. Each module should encapsulate related components, services, and other code.

**Example**: Create a "User" module for user-related components and services, and a "Product" module for product-related code.

## 4. Use Lazy Loading for Routing

**Best Practice**: Use lazy loading for routing to load modules on demand, reducing the initial bundle size.

**Example**: Define a route like this in your app's routing configuration:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then((m) => m.AdminModule) },
];
```

## 5. Optimize Change Detection

**Best Practice**: Minimize the use of the `OnPush` change detection strategy and use the `async` pipe for handling asynchronous data.

**Example**: In a component, set the change detection strategy to `OnPush` and use the `async` pipe for observables:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: '<p>{{ data$ | async }}</p>',
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data$ = this.dataService.getData();
}
```

## 6. Utilize NgRx for State Management

**Best Practice**: Use NgRx for complex state management in your Angular applications. It promotes a predictable state container.

**Example**: Implement NgRx for managing application state, including actions, reducers, and effects.

## 7. Implement Feature Toggles

**Best Practice**: Use feature toggles to enable or disable certain features or parts of your application based on configuration.

**Example**: Create a service that checks a configuration setting to enable or disable a feature:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class FeatureToggleService {
  isFeatureEnabled(featureName: string): boolean {
    return someConfig[featureName] === true;
  }
}
```

## 8. Optimize Performance

**Best Practice**: Implement performance optimizations such as lazy loading, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and minimizing HTTP requests.

**Example**: Enable AOT compilation by running:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

## 9. Write Unit Tests

**Best Practice**: Write unit tests for your components, services, and other code to ensure the reliability of your application.

**Example**: Write unit tests for a component using tools like Jasmine and Karma.

```typescript
it('should create', () => {
  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
  const app = fixture.componentInstance;
  expect(app).toBeTruthy();
});
```

These best practices will help you develop Angular applications that are more maintainable, performant, and scalable.
